# BCG-GENAI---Internship---Task---Forage
Your primary objective is to extract and analyze key financial data from the client's 10-K and 10-Q documents. This involves understanding financial statements, identifying significant trends, and preparing data for AI-driven applications.
Following the data analysis, you will develop an AI-powered financial chatbot. This chatbot must be capable of analyzing financial data and providing insights that effectively communicate complex financial information in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
Throughout the project, your focus will not only be on the technical execution but also on how these AI-driven insights can be leveraged in a consulting context to provide strategic recommendations and solutions to clients.
